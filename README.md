# BlazorHybridApp
This repository contains a template for a Blazor Hybrid application that can run on the web, desktop (Windows, Mac, and Linux), and mobile (iOS and Android) platforms. The app demonstrates using Blazor components, data binding, and platform-specific functionality.

Components
The app includes the following Blazor components:

Counter
A simple counter component that increments and displays the count. The increment amount can be customized via a parameter.

Todo
A to-do list component that allows adding, removing, and updating to-do items. The to-do items are persisted across application sessions using the FileSystem API.

Weather
A weather forecast component that displays a table of forecasts. The forecasts are generated randomly to demonstrate data binding and rendering.
